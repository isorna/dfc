Space Stations

In Dropfleet Commander we refer to these constructs large enough to interact with as

` `Space Stations . For simplicities sake we group these into three categories: **Small, Medium** and **Large.** Space Stations are treated as ships in game (in that they can be targeted etc) although they do not move and follow the exceptions below.

Space Stations are always deployed in Low Orbit unless stated otherwise in the Scenario and may not change Orbital Layer.

Placing Scenery

Each Scenario will define exactly where scoring scenery should be placed. In addition, most Scenarios will define a rough amount of additional scenery

(Debris Fields, Planetary Rings etc) that you should use.
