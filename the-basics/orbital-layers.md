# Capas orbitales

_Las reglas básicas de Dropfleet cubren el combate espacial, pero la verdad es que batallas en mitad del espacio son bastantes raras. El verdadero motivo de las batallas espaciales es la conquista de planetas en el sistema solar. Debido a esto la mayoría de combates ocurren cerca de planetas habitables (o al menos conolizables), lunas o cuerpos celestiales._

Once an enemy fleet moves in to try to knock down satellite coverage and bombard targets on the surface it is only a matter of time before a full-blown invasion will be launched. This is the point where a defending fleet is forced to stand and fight or surrender control of the planet altogether.

There are three  heights  or layers in orbital combat, with the table surface nominally representing ground level and ships floating somewhere in the layers above.

## High Orbit/Space

Combat is rare in actual deep space but common in high orbit. Most large ships are designed to operate at this level, and as such are most effective in High orbit. Severe damage when at lower orbital layers is liable to cause Orbital Decay, a situation that can very easily become terminal for such large vessels.

## Low Orbit

The exact parameters for what constitutes Low Orbit can vary a lot from planet to planet depending on composition and atmosphere. This  interface  layer is the most common battleground for ships as attacking ships must come down to Low Orbit at some point to launch an invasion force, bombard the surface, and claim key orbits.

## Atmosphere

Few ships are Atmosphere-capable, and even Strike Craft or munitions have to be specially configured to operate in Atmosphere without burning up on entry. However, to conquer a planet the invading force must enter Atmosphere in order to make a landing.

## Limitations in Atmosphere

**Atmosphere may only be entered by ships with the Atmospheric special rule.** Any other ships are destroyed on entry. Ships in Atmosphere have their available Thrust reduced to 2". Ships moving into Atmosphere therefore lose any remaining movement apart from this 2".

**Ships moving out of Atmosphere into Low Orbit must do so at the start of their movement,** and follow the rules for moving up an Orbital Layer and do not suffer this penalty. (see Moving between Orbital Layers).
